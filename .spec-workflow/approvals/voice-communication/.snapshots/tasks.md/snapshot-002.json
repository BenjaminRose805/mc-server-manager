The function: (1) Reads livekit_api_key and livekit_api_secret from the settings table. (2) Throws an Error with message 'LiveKit credentials not configured' if either is empty. (3) Creates an AccessToken from livekit-server-sdk with identity set to userId, name set to username, and ttl set to '6h'. (4) Adds a grant with roomJoin: true, room: channelId, canPublish: true, canSubscribe: true. (5) Generates the JWT via at.toJwt(). (6) Returns an object with the token string and wsUrl as 'ws://localhost:7880' (reads livekit_port from settings to build the URL). Reference `plans/EPIC-8-voice.md` Phase 8C.2 token generation code. | Restrictions: Never expose API key/secret to the client. Token must be scoped to the specific room (channelId). Use `.js` extension in imports. Follow existing service patterns. | Success: Token generation produces valid JWT, grants are room-scoped, wsUrl includes correct port, missing credentials throw clear error._\n\n- [ ] 7.

On shortcut event, emit a \"push-to-talk\" event to the frontend with the event type (KeyDown/KeyUp) as payload. (C) Create `packages/frontend/src/hooks/usePushToTalk.ts`. Import listen from @tauri-apps/api/event and voiceStore. The hook: listens for \"push-to-talk\" Tauri events. On KeyDown payload, call room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true). On KeyUp payload, if localMuted was true before, call room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(false). Only active when room exists. Cleanup listener on unmount. Return cleanup function from useEffect. Reference `plans/EPIC-8-voice.md` Phases 8F.1-8F.3. | Restrictions: Global shortcut must work when app is NOT focused. Clean up event listener on component unmount. Do NOT modify existing Rust code beyond adding the shortcut registration.

Make these changes: (1) Add `livekit_child: Mutex<Option<CommandChild>>` to AppState. (2) Create `spawn_livekit(app: &tauri::AppHandle)` function: get the app data dir, build the config path (data_dir/livekit-config.yaml), poll for the config file to exist (check every 500ms for up to 10 seconds -- the backend writes it on startup), spawn the livekit-server sidecar with args `[\"--config\", config_path]`, store child in AppState, spawn async task to forward stdout/stderr to log macros with \"[livekit]\" prefix, handle Terminated event by logging exit code and signal. (3) In setup function, call spawn_livekit after spawn_backend. (4) In quit handler, kill livekit_child BEFORE killing backend_child (LiveKit first, then backend which stops MC servers). (B) Read `packages/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Add \"binaries/livekit-server\" to the bundle.externalBin array alongside the existing backend entry. Reference `plans/EPIC-8-voice.md` Phases 8B.1, 8B.3, 8B.4. | Restrictions: Do NOT break existing backend sidecar management. LiveKit must start AFTER backend (needs config file). Kill order: LiveKit first, then backend. Config polling must have a timeout (do not block forever). | Success: LiveKit spawned after backend, config polling works, graceful shutdown kills LiveKit before backend, sidecar registered in tauri.conf.json._\n\n- [ ] 15.

Make these changes: (1) Import VoiceChannelList from components/voice/VoiceChannelList. Add it to the layout as a right sidebar (w-64 fixed width) or integrate it into an existing sidebar. It should be visible on all authenticated pages. (2) Import usePushToTalk from hooks/usePushToTalk. Call it in the top-level App component or a layout wrapper so push-to-talk is active globally. (3) Optionally add a route or modal for VoiceSettings component, accessible from the voice controls area. Reference `plans/EPIC-8-voice.md` Phase 8E.2. | Restrictions: Do NOT restructure existing routes or layouts. Voice sidebar should not interfere with existing content.
