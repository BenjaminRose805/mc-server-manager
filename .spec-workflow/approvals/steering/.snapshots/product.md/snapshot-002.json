It provides a browser-based dashboard and an Electron desktop app to create, configure, start/stop, and monitor Minecraft servers running on the local machine or home server.\n\nThe product is evolving from a single-user server management tool into a **self-hosted community platform** that supports multiple users, social features, and game launching -- a private alternative to public Minecraft server hosting services.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary: Self-Hosting Server Operators\n- Technically capable enough to run a home server or VPS\n- Want a GUI instead of SSH + command line for server management\n- Run 1-5 Minecraft servers for their friend group or small community\n- Expect things to \"just work\" after initial setup\n\n### Secondary: Community Members (Players)\n- Friends/players invited by the server operator\n- Use the desktop app to launch Minecraft and chat\n- Not necessarily technical -- need simple UX\n- Care about: joining games, chatting with friends, seeing who's online\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Implemented\n1. **Server Management**: Create, configure, start/stop, restart Minecraft Java servers via web dashboard\n2. **Live Console**: Real-time server console with command input (WebSocket-based, virtualized rendering with @tanstack/react-virtual)\n3. **Server Properties Editor**: Edit server.properties through the UI\n4. **Multi-Server Support**: Run multiple servers simultaneously, each with independent configuration\n5. **System Monitoring**: Java detection, system info, server status tracking\n6. **Server Mod Management**: Search Modrinth, install/update/remove server mods, dependency resolution, modpack import/export (.mrpack)\n7. **Electron Desktop App**: Window management, system tray, close-to-tray, backend lifecycle management\n8. **Microsoft Auth + Game Launching**: Sign in with Microsoft account (device code flow), launch Minecraft from the app, manage game instances and versions\n9. **Client Mod Management**: Manage client-side mods on game instances, Modrinth search, dependency resolution, modpack support\n10. **Multi-User Foundation**: User registration (invite-only), roles (owner/admin/member), JWT auth with refresh tokens, per-server permissions, TLS/HTTPS, rate limiting, CORS, brute-force protection\n\n### In Progress (Specs ready, implementation pending)\n- **Friends & Text Chat** (18 tasks): Friend requests, presence tracking (online/in-game/offline), text channels, direct messages, desktop notifications\n- **Shared Minecraft Servers** (17 tasks): Share servers with community members, permission model (view/join/manage/admin), whitelist sync, server browser\n- **Voice Communication** (15 tasks): LiveKit-based voice channels, push-to-talk, mute/deafen, speaking indicators, audio device selection\n- **Mod Sync** (11 tasks): Auto-synchronize mods when joining a shared server, hash verification, trusted source validation, one-click join\n\n### Pipeline (Spec started, design pending)\n- **Electron Desktop Builds**: CI/CD pipeline for cross-platform Electron installers via GitHub Actions\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Self-hosted first**: Users own their data and infrastructure. No SaaS dependencies.\n- **Community-oriented**: Build features that make small Minecraft communities thrive (chat, friends, shared servers)\n- **Desktop + Web**: Full functionality in the browser, enhanced experience in the Electron desktop app (auth, game launching, notifications)\n- **Single codebase**: TypeScript everywhere (no Rust, no polyglot complexity)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Feature completeness against the phased build plan (PLAN.md)\n- Reliability of server management (zero orphaned processes, clean shutdown)\n- Smooth multi-user experience (invite-to-playing flow under 5 minutes)\n- Cross-platform desktop builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Self-hosted simplicity**: Setup should be `npm install && npm run dev`. No Docker required, no external services.\n2. **Graceful degradation**: Every feature that requires Electron (auth, game launch) must degrade gracefully in the browser with a clear message.\n3. **Single-user backward compatibility**: The multi-user system must not break the experience for someone running the app solo without setting up accounts.\n4. **Real-time by default**: Server status, console output, chat messages, and presence are all live via WebSocket. No polling.\n5. **Dark theme**: The entire UI uses a consistent dark theme (slate-800/900). No light mode.\n6. **Minimal external dependencies**: Prefer built-in Node.js/Electron APIs over adding npm packages. When packages are needed, prefer well-maintained, focused libraries.\n\n## Platform & Distribution\n\n- **Web Dashboard**: Accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (dev) or served by the backend in production\n- **Electron Desktop App**: Packaged via electron-builder for Windows (NSIS), macOS (DMG), Linux (AppImage + DEB)\n- **Backend**: Express server running on the same machine as the Minecraft servers (port 3001)\n- **No Cloud**: Everything runs locally. Network access is opt-in (TLS, UPnP port forwarding for friends to connect)\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Near-term (current spec backlog)\n- Complete social features (friends, chat, voice)\n- Mod synchronization between server and clients on join\n- Shared server management with role-based permissions\n- Automated cross-platform desktop builds via GitHub Actions\n\n### Longer-term (not yet specified)\n- **Backup & Restore**: Scheduled world backups with point-in-time recovery\n- **Plugin Management**: Browse, install, and update server plugins from the dashboard\n- **Scheduled Tasks**: Restart schedules, backup schedules, announcement schedules\n- **Remote Access**: Tunnel/relay for accessing the dashboard without port forwarding\n- **Analytics**: Player activity, server performance graphs, uptime tracking\n\n## Epic Dependency Chain\n\n```\nEpic 1: Server Management (MVP) ✅\nEpic 2: Server Mod Management ✅\n  └── depends on: Epic 1\nEpic 3: Client Launcher ✅ (reimplemented in Electron)\n  └── depends on: Desktop Shell\nEpic 4: Client Mod Management ✅ (reimplemented in Electron)\n  └── depends on: Epic 2, Epic 3\nEpic 5: Multi-User Foundation ✅\n  └── depends on: Epic 1\nEpic 6: Friends & Text Chat 🔜\n  └── depends on: Epic 5\nEpic 7: Shared Minecraft Servers 🔜\n  └── depends on: Epic 5, optionally Epic 3\nEpic 8: Voice Communication 🔜\n  └── depends on: Epic 5\nEpic 9: Mod Sync 🔜\n  └── depends on: Epic 2, Epic 4, Epic 7\n```\n",
