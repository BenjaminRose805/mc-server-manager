# Implementation Log: Task 10

**Summary:** Ran full project build (shared → backend → frontend) with zero errors. Verified all 7 cleanup targets via grep: no inline Zod validation blocks, no unsafe double-casts, no authFetch references, no raw Error throws in providers/services (except intentional cancellation + database guard), LoaderType derived from ModLoader, MinecraftVersion derived from MojangVersionEntry.
